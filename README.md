This repository was created for the paper:

"**Location-scale models in ecology: heteroscedasticity in continuous, count and proportion data**"


The online tutorial is available here: https://anonymous.4open.science/w/Eco_location-scale_model-29BE/


To fully reproduce the `R` code shown in the tutorial, you will need to download the following:
  - `online_tutorial.qmd`
  - All datasets in the `data` folder
  - RDS files from the Google Drive folder (link below)

Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CvshmYMowXSB9MdbCprP1LP7llZNxIbe?usp=drive_link

Please save the RDS files in a folder named `Rdata` inside the same directory that contains `online_tutorial.qmd` and the `data` folder.
If everything is placed correctly, the `.qmd` file should run without any issues :)

In addition, the folder repro_package contains all data and scripts used in this tutorial, compiled into single files for convenience:
  - An `.RData` file that includes all datasets used in the analyses
  - A single `.R` script that consolidates all code used throughout the tutorial
